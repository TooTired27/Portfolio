            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><span id="highlighted">Hey!</span> My name is Pamela Mtshali, I am a BCom Computer Science student at Nelson Mandela University, in South Africa. I love cats and just like how curious cats are, i have always been curious about how things come to life.</p>
            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>I am someone who has multiple interests, but for now we'll digest tech related interests. I have a keen interest in the planning and implementation processes that bring technology to life. My curiosity extends to the inner workings of machines and how they collaborate with software and design. Specifically, I am fascinated by the art and science of sound engineering in film, where one explores how audio is crafted and layered to create immersive experiences. This passion for creation also drives my fascination with the video game development lifecycle, from the initial concept and design to the technical implementation that results in a playable and engaging world.</p>
            <h2>Educational Background</h2>
            <p>As mention i am an undergraduate student, in her second year and also a student at the Power Learning Programme. See my CV below...</p>
